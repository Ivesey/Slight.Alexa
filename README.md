# Slight.Alexa

> Alexa, the voice service that powers Echo, provides a set of built-in abilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. With the Alexa Skills Kit, you can easily build and add your own skills to Alexa. Customers can access these new skills simply by asking Alexa a question or making a command.

This project contains a set of managed C# models and helpers to integrate Amazon's Alexa skill services into your .Net stack.

Currently, within Slight.Alexa you will find typed .Net models for Alexa service requests and responses.
